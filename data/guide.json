  "questions": [
    "Have you ever received an invitation that made you feel valued and welcomed?",
    "Read Luke 2:8-21. What do these verses reveal about the shepherds? How did the shepherds respond to the angel’s message?",
    "John Francis Wade reflected on this passage in 1743, and it inspired him to write O Come, All Ye Faithful. Read the lyrics from the song: O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant! O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; Come and behold him Born the King of Angels: O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.",
    "What does this song invite us to do? Can you think of examples in your own life of showing adoration for someone or something?",
    "As you reflect on your current season, what are some things that are competing for your attention? What might it look like for us to adore Christ in the coming days?",
    "What about the Christmas story seems most wonderful to you—the fact that God became human, that God acted to redeem humanity, or that God’s invitation includes you? Spend some in thanking and adoring God for who He is and for His loving actions towards us."
